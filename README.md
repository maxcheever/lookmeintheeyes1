# _Look Me in the Eyes I_
~ artistic explanation here ~
<br><br><br>
## Technical Approach
_Look Me in the Eyes I_ is an image processor that rearranges or "remixes" the pixels of an source image to resemble a target image as closely as possible. I chose to accomplish this through the use of [openFrameworks](https://openframeworks.cc), an open source C++ toolkit for creative coding.
### Target Image Pixel Sorting
The best way to create a remix of the source image that closely resembled the target image is to map the pixels according to brightness. Therefore, I needed to know in what positions the brightest pixels  


## Results

This project is a part of DART 496, an image/video processing and remix theory independent study with [Professor Eduardo Navas](http://navasse.net/docs/index.php). Resources used for _Look Me in the Eyes I_ include the [openFrameworks graphics documentation](https://openframeworks.cc/documentation/graphics/) and the chapter ["Image Processing and Computer Vision" from _ofBook_](https://openframeworks.cc/ofBook/chapters/image_processing_computer_vision.html)
